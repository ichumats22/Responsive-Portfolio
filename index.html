      I am originally from Venezuela but have lived in the Phoenix Metro area since 2005. I graduated
      from Higley High School in Gilbert in 2013 and spent a year at Arizona State Downtown Campus before
      moving to Michigan to attend the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. After two long winters I learned 
      that Seasonal Affective Disorder is a real thing and moved back to sunny Arizona. I finished my 
      undergraduate degree through ASU online and graduated in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Justice Studies. 
      I loved earning my degree as I am passionate about social justice but unfortunately, it has not provided many 
      concrete opportunities to do the type of work I am interested in without additional schooling.

      Currently, I am working as a remote service specialist for State Farm agents in Arizona and New Mexico.
      I handle routine tasks such as late payment reminders and document/information requests. I love my 
      job because it allows me the opportunity to work from home but the repetitive nature of it makes it 
      unlikely I will be able to continue this work for years to come. 
    </p>

      In my spare time I love to do yoga, craft, read, and binge streamable content. I also spend a lot of time 
      with my adorable dog child, Scarlet. She is a three-year old German Shepherd who is both a major pain in 
      the butt and my favorite creature alive.

      I am learning to code because it is an industry I find fascinating and one which I have been insterested in 
      entering for several years now. It is clear that the future will be created by developers and I am excited to 
      join the ranks. Already I have learned so much and been able to create things I never would've been able to 
      before. I look forward to utilizing the skills I learn in this course to create a long-lasting, stable career
      that is both fulfilling and allows me the freedom and flexibility to accomplish my goals.
